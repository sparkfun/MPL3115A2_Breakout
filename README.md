*MPL3115A2 Altitude/Pressure Sensor Breakout (SEN-11084)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11084)

The MPL3115A2 is a MEMS pressure sensor that provides Altitude data to within 30cm (with oversampling enabled). The sensor outputs are digitized by a high resolution 24-bit ADC and transmitted over I2C, meaning it's easy to interface with most controllers.
